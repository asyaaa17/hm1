# Assembly Analysis 

## Step 1: Evaluate Assembly Quality with QUAST
Use the QUAST tool to assess the quality of the assembly. QUAST provides valuable metrics for evaluating the assembly's completeness and accuracy.

## Step 2: Identify Candidate Contigs
Utilize the provided Python program and Linux commands to identify potential viral contigs.

## Step 3: Perform BLAST Analysis
Analyze the top hits for similarity (% Identity) and identify the host.

## Step 4: Sequence Annotation
To enhance the understanding of the nucleotide sequence, annotate it using the Prokka package.
